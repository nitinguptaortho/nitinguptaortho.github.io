      <h4>
        Have you ever wondered why your parents or grandparents complain of knee
        pain so frequently? Or why the term knee replacement has become almost a
        household phrase in many Indian families? The culprit is often
        Osteoarthritis (OA), and its grip on our ageing population is firm and
        persistent.

            <h4>What is Osteoarthritis?</h4>
            <p>
              Osteoarthritis, often referred to as wear and tear arthritis, is a
              degenerative joint condition. It predominantly affects the
              cartilage, causing it to thin and wear away, leading to painful
              bone-on-bone friction.

            <h4>Why is Osteoarthritis Prevalent in India?</h4>
            <p>
              - Aging Population: As life expectancy in India rises, so does the
              prevalence of age-related ailments like OA.
              <br />
              - Lifestyle Factors: Sedentary lifestyles, ospanesity, and lack of
              regular exercise can exacerbate OA symptoms.
              <br />
              - Genetic Predisposition: Some studies suggest South Asians might
              have a genetic inclination towards developing OA.
            </p>
            <h5>The Road to Knee Replacement:</h5>
            <p>
              - Last Resort: Knee replacements are usually considered when all
              other treatments fail to provide relief.
              <br />
              - Increasing Numbers: With the rise of OA cases, India witnesses
              an escalating number of knee replacement surgeries annually. If
              you're considering this route, searching for the best knee
              replacement surgeon in Jaipur or similar might be on your radar.

          <h5>Benefits of Knee Replacement:</h5>
          <p>
            - Relief from Chronic Pain: The procedure can offer a drastic
            reduction in pain for OA sufferers.
            <br />
            - Improved Mobility: Post-surgery, many patients find a renewed
            ability to walk, climb stairs, and engage in activities they'd given
            up due to pain.
          </p>
          <h5>In Conclusion</h5>
          <p>
            The surge in Osteoarthritis cases has undeniably positioned it as a
            leading cause for knee replacement surgeries in India. Being
            informed, staying active, and consulting experts can go a long way
            in managing the condition. And if surgery becomes a necessity,
            remember to research thoroughly, perhaps beginning with the best
            knee replacement surgeon in Jaipur.
