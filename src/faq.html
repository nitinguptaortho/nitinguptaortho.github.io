            qualifications. It's also beneficial to seek referrals and meet the

            post-traumatic arthritis, rotator cuff tear arthropathy, and
            avascular necrosis can lead to the need for joint replacements.
          </p>
          <h2>9. When should I see a ligament specialist?</h2>

            pain, swelling, or instability in a joint, seeing a ligament
            specialist is advisable.
          </p>
