            <h4>What is Osteoarthritis?</h4>
            <p>
              Osteoarthritis, often referred to as wear and tear arthritis, is a
              degenerative joint condition. It predominantly affects the
              cartilage, causing it to thin and wear away, leading to painful
              bone-on-bone friction.

            <h5>The Essence of Yoga</h5>
            <p>
              - Mind-Body Connection: Yoga emphasises the harmonisation of mind
              and body, promoting holistic wellness.

              <br />
              - Versatility: From gentle poses to intense stretches, yoga offers
              something for every fitness level.
            </p>
            <h5>How Does Yoga Benefit Joint Health?</h5>
            <p>
              - Flexibility: Regular practice can lead to increased joint and
              muscle flexibility, reducing the chances of injuries.

              <br />
              - Strengthens Muscles: By building muscle around the joints, yoga
              can provide added support and reduce strain.
              <br />
              - Boosts Circulation: Improved blood flow aids in the delivery of
              nutrients to joint and muscle tissues, promoting healing and
              reducing inflammation.

          <h5>Modern Orthopaedics & Yoga</h5>
          <p>
            - Complementary Practices: Many orthopaedists now recommend yoga as
            a preventive measure or alongside other treatments.

            <br />
            - Research-Backed: Several studies have shown yoga’s positive
            effects on conditions like Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis.
          </p>
          <h5>Yoga Tips for Joint Protection</h5>
          <p>
            - Start Slow: Especially if new to yoga or experiencing joint pain,
            begin with gentler poses and gradually advance.
            <br />
            - Listen to Your Body: If a pose causes pain beyond mild discomfort,
            it’s essential to adjust or skip it.
            <br />
            - Prior Consultation: If pre-existing joint concerns are a factor,
            it’s wise to consult a medical expert. You might even consider
            seeking advice from the best orthopaedic doctor in Jaipur for a
            tailored approach
          </p>
          <h5>In Conclusion</h5>
          <p>
            As traditional Indian practices like yoga seamlessly integrate with
            modern orthopaedic solutions, it offers hope and holistic care for
            those battling joint issues. It's a reminder of the timeless wisdom
            of our ancestors and how it can pave the way for healthier living
            today.
